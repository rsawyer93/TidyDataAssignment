This codebook describes the variables used in this analysis. 

The data has been taken from a study into accelerometer signals from a Samsung Galaxy S. The measurements in the study were taken from 30 people (subjects), performing 6 different acitivies. 
A multitude of variables were collected from the signals. 

The variables collected and extracted in this analysis were the mean and standard deviation of the following in the X, Y and Z directions for each acitivity for each subject:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

Adittional the following variables were also collected for the X,Y and Z directions. 
angle.gravityMean
angle.tBodyAccMean
angle.tBodyAccJerkMean
angle.tBodyGyroMean
angle.tBodyGyroJerkMean

The mean of each of the variables listed above was then calculated for each acitivity and subject. 

This is the output of the of the run_analysis.R script
